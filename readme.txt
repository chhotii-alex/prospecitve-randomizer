How to run Prospective Randomizer server:

Three items must be in the same folder on the server computer:
server.jar
groups.txt
variables.xml

Command line for starting Prospective Randomizer server:
java -jar server.jar

This is the Prospective Randomizer server used for Barsky's Reactivation study (2015-2016).
However there's a new improved Prospective Randomizer program which I'll put up in a separate repo.
